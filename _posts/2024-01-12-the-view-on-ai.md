During this month I've been starting to get into artificial intelligence and its quite the debateable topic as theres many different takes on how AI should be used and where it shouldnt be used etc. I found many different perspectives including from my peers on the subject of using AI in fields like education and my classmates have brought many valid points about the way AI can aid in education when the teachers arent available but also points where AI like chatgpt can be used to cheat in exams or writing essays using AI for classes. 

Recently I've watched WALL-E which is a movie about a ruined earth and the remaining humans roamed the earth while AI worked hard to try to clean up th earth and then theres also AI on the axiom who try to keep humans away from heading back to earth. The role of ai in the movie wall-e is seemingly like humans who have replaced the humans who are on the axioms and are more like kids still learning as shown by the bonding process between WALL-E and EVE. I believe that WAll-E and EVE served as a wakeup call to those aboard the axiom and it woke them up from being stuck and absorbed into their interfaces without ever doing anything and taking a look at those around them which is shown when wall-e wakes up one of the male residents aboard the axiom from his shuttle and chair and he finally takes a look around him. AI systems like wall-e and auto are depicted in the movie as the good and bad to artificial intelligence like the dangers and then wall-e is the good side of arificial super intelligence. For example wall-e and eve are super intelligence that are trying to restore earth and return everyone and basically the good and ups of super intelligence and auto exists to serve the complete opposite which is to show one of the bad outcomes for artifical intelligence as auto was trying to stop humans from returning to earth. 

AI can be good but can also bring along ethical issues in the movie as shown in WALL-e by auto since auto prioritize his mission given by his creator over the wishes of the current caption and that raises ethical issues because in that effort he had also threatened the residents and also the captain with a taser to accomplish his goal which was to not allow them to return to earth. Ethical issues was that the AI was also able to lie by grabbing the plant and tossing it away and if AI can lie as well then it would be hard to trust the things AI say and it also shows that AI has the ability to scheme like humans can in which they will be no different from smart dangerous criminals. These issues relate to real-world AI ethics issues which is safety and in the movie, not only did auto not gurantee the safety of its passengers but also endangered them by oversteering the ship to get rid of the captain.

In the movie wall-e relationships between AI characters are possible as shown by the interaction between wall-e and eve and the other rogue bots and that shows the good part of relationship building between ai similar to humans can and the learning process is also shown within eve who originally only cared for her objective which was the plant but however changed once she saw her security footage and also towards the end which she chose to abandon her objective assigned to her for WALL-E. Similarly WALL-E changed many of the residents lives but mostly the male at the start in which he woke up from his trance of being chronically online etc. The film shows potential for AI-Human bonds and that they are possible as depicted near the end where the captain and the first two residents woken up by WALL-E and EVE are greiving because of the state WALL-E was reduced to while assisting them in returning to earth. However the dangers are also depicted in AI-Human relationships as shown by AUTO which only cared about his purpose to prevent the return to earth instead of the current captain. 

The future of AI both have its ups and downs which have been shown in the movie WALL-E like for example AI can assist in doing work for humans that are normally proven difficult such as cleaning up the environment since it can be equipped with sensors meant to see contamination that human eyes can not see etc and also being able to be way more organized and keep order unlike humans but it also has its downs since AI can malfunction and because of that become a danger to humans around it as it can cause massive levels of destruction. Atlhough a society heavily reliant on AI is really simple and allows you to live a carefree and relaxed life without the need of having to do anything but the drawback is that everyone would be obese and chronically online as shown by the residents on the axiom and also the fact they were having difficulties getting up and walking shows what a AI heavy society does to you. Overall AI comes with both its risks and benefits and it just depends on how it become implemented and what countermeasures are taken. This potrayal of AI intergration can seemingly be accurate and it highlights many potential drawbacks and effects for the mass implementation of AI in the daily life of humans however it will still take many decades before AI will reach the level shown in the movie WALL-E.
